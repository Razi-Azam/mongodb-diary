# The above object shows one to one relationship because 
# the diseaseSummary document is embedded directly 
# inside the parent document. 


# The diseaseSummary is an embedded subdocument
# within the parent document.
# It represents information related to the
# parent (name: max) in a one-to-one manner â€” 
# i.e., each person has exactly one diseaseSummary.
